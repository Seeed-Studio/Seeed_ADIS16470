Introduction of sensor
----------------------------  
>1.  The ADIS16470 is a miniature MEMS inertial measurement unit (IMU) that includes a triaxial gyroscope and a triaxial accelerometer. The ADIS16470 provides a simple, cost effective method for integrating accurate, multiaxis inertial sensing into industrial systems, especially when compared with the complexity and investment associated with discrete designs.
>2.  Triaxial, digital gyroscope, ±2000°/sec dynamic range,8°/hr in run bias stability ,0.008°/sec/√Hz rms rate noise density ,Triaxial, digital accelerometer dynamic range: ±40 g ,13 µg in run bias stability .

***
Usage:
==========  
Download all the source files and open BurstRead_demo/BurstRead_demo.ino in arduino IDE. Compile and download and run it on a arduino board.

****
Notice:
=========
>1. This BurstRead_demo/BurstRead_demo.ino is just a simple display demo for general use case.
>2. Here is the raw data of the sensor, and the application needs to process the data by itself.
>3. In the middle, STM32 chip is used as the adapter. If necessary, the basic parameters of the sensor should be adjusted, files Stm32F030_Firmware/Stm32F030_Firmware.ino should be rewritten, and the firmware should be re-written by SWD.
